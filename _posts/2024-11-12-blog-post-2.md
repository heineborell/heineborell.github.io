# The general structure
First I thought I probably don't need a relational database for the questions I
am going to answer and I just started to construct it to learn more about SQL
and practice. But later especially with the data I scraped from strava it
proved to be really useful. So before discussing the scraping I will go over
the database structure. I start with the relation table below.
<pre class='mermaid'>
erDiagram
    tdf_results {str name FK
  int year
  int time}

    strava_names {int athlete_id PK
  str name}

    segments_data {int activity_id PK
  int athlete_id FK

  }
    stats_data {int activity_id PK
  int athlete_id FK

  }
     strava_names||--|{  tdf_results: ""
     strava_names||--|{  segments_data: ""
     strava_names||--|{  stats_data: ""
  </pre>
The main tables we have are the `tdf_results`, `giro_results` that are scraped from [ProCyclingStats](https://www.procyclingstats.com). These tables do not contain any primary keys i.e. unique values as they have the following structure
![](/images/post_images/ss_2_1.png)
The names repeat at every stage at each year with the time of each rider and stage properties.
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;"> <img
	src="/images/post_images/ss_2_2.png" alt="Description" style="width:
	250px; margin-right: 20px;"> <p>

The columns of these tables in more detail are as follows. The column names
are explanatory may be except the <code>profile_score</code> and <code>starlist_quality</code> where
they each have their definition from in the links. The amount of data from these tables is qctually pretty good fro analysis and unless we include strava data its quite easy to extract data with SQL queries once we have the question in mind.</p> </div>
