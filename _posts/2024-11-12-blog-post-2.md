# The general structure
First I thought I probably don't need a relational database for the questions I
am going to answer and I just started to construct it to learn more about SQL
and practice. But later especially with the data I scraped from strava it
proved to be really useful. So before discussing the scraping I will go over
the database structure. I start with the table below.
<pre class='mermaid'>
erDiagram
    tdf_results {int city_id}
    giro_results {}
    df_name {ds ds}
    segmets_data {entry entry}
    COUNTRY ||--|{ STATE : ""
    STATE ||--|{ CITY : ""
    CITY ||--o| STATE : ""
    CITY ||--o| COUNTRY : ""
  </pre>
The main tables we have are the `tdf_results`, `giro_results` that are scraped from [ProCyclingStats](https://www.procyclingstats.com). These tables do not contain any primary keys i.e. unique values as they have the following structure
![](/images/post_images/ss_2_1.png)

![](/images/ss_2_1.png)
The names repeat at every stage at each year with the time of each rider and stage properties.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;"> <img
	src="../images/post_images/ss_2_2.png" alt="Description" style="width:
	250px; margin-right: 20px;"> <p>

The columns in more detail are as follows. The column names
are explanatory may be except the `profile_score` and `starlist_quality` where
they each have their definition from in the links. </p> </div>
