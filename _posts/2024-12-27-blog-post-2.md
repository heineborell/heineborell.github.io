# The general structure
Initially, I thought a relational database might not be necessary for the
questions I wanted to address. However, I decided to create one anyway to
deepen my understanding of SQL and gain practical experience. Over time,
particularly with the data I scraped from Strava, the database proved to be quite
useful. Before diving into the details of the scraping process,
I'll first discuss the structure of the database, starting with the relational
table outlined below.
<pre class='mermaid'>
erDiagram
    tdf_results {str name FK
  int year
  int time}

    strava_names {int athlete_id PK
  str name}

    segments_data {int activity_id PK
  int athlete_id FK

  }
    stats_data {int activity_id PK
  int athlete_id FK

  }
     strava_names||--|{  tdf_results: ""
     strava_names||--|{  segments_data: ""
     strava_names||--|{  stats_data: ""
  </pre>
The primary tables in our database are `tdf_results` and `giro_results`, which
were scraped from [ProCyclingStats](https://www.procyclingstats.com). These
tables do not have primary keys (i.e., unique values) because their structure
involves repeated entries for each rider across different stages and years, as
shown below:

![Table structure example 1](/images/post_images/ss_2_1.png)


<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;"> <img
  src="/images/post_images/ss_2_2.png" alt="Description" style="width: 250px;
  margin-right: 20px;"> <p>Each row includes the rider's name, the time for a
    specific stage, and the stage properties, which repeat across different
    stages and years. On the left we have the summary of the columns. The
    columns in these tables are largely self-explanatory, with the possible
    exceptions of <code>profile_score</code> and <code>starlist_quality</code>.
    These terms have specific definitions, which can be found in the original
    source links. Unless Strava data is included, it is relatively
    straightforward to extract insights using SQL queries, provided the
    questions are well-defined. </p> </div>


<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">  
  <img src="/images/post_images/ss_2_7.png" alt="Description" style="width: 250px; margin-right: 20px;">  
  <p>Working with Strava datasets requires a more intricate approach for both scraping and structuring. We start with the <code>strava_names</code> table, which contains riders' <code>names</code> and their unique <code>athlete_id</code>. While constructing this table, I assumed that the names in the <code>results</code> table are unique. This assumption is reasonable, as the dataset only includes results from 2010 onward, aligning with Strava's historical data coverage. I will elaborate further on constructing this table later.</p>  
</div>

The more data-intensive Strava tables are `segments_data` and `stats_data`. As the name suggests, `segments_data` is scraped from the segment information of a Strava ride. This table can become quite extensive, depending on the number of segments. It includes details such as time, speed, VAM (Vertical Ascent in Meters), power, and heart rateâ€”if the rider has chosen to upload these metrics.

![Table structure example 5](/images/post_images/ss_2_5.png)

In the `segments_data` table, I chose to keep the `activity_id`, `athlete_id`, `date`, and `distance` fields explicit while bundling the `segments` data into a JSON blob. Since the `activity_id` serves as the primary key, it can efficiently distinguish between rides. A snapshot of the table can be seen below.

![Table structure example 3](/images/post_images/ss_2_3.png)

The `stats_data` table contains general data scraped from Strava ride summaries. Since the type of data varies significantly between rides, it also makes sense to store this information as a JSON blob, similar to the `segments_data` table.

The following provides an example of the structure of the `stats_data` table, along with detailed column information for the `segments` and `stats` tables.
